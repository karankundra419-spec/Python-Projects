# Python-Projects
This Python project focuses on data processing and automation through scripting. It includes functionality for filtering, aggregating, analyzing, and visualizing data using popular Python libraries. The project is designed to streamline repetitive tasks and enable users to extract meaningful insights from datasets effortlessly.

This project is a Python-based data analytics capstone that demonstrates the ability to create and manipulate data, clean datasets, automate calculations, merge multiple sources, and perform exploratory analysis using Pandas and NumPy. The notebook walks through creating structured datasets, saving them as CSV files, performing operations such as grouping, sorting, merging, and generating analytical insights that could support real-world business use cases.

The project shows practical skills in data preprocessing and programmatically building a workflow from raw input to clean and meaningful output.

# 🎯 Objectives

Create and manage DataFrames programmatically

Export datasets into CSV format

Perform cleaning & formatting of tabular data

Merge datasets and join multiple DataFrames

Apply business logic using conditional operations and calculated fields

Conduct descriptive analysis to extract insights

Automate the end-to-end data processing workflow

# Technologies & Libraries Library	Purpose :
Pandas(Data manipulation and analysis),
NumPy(Mathematical operations & array processing)
Python(Core programming language)

# Tasks covered in the notebook : 
Create DataFrames manually, Save and read CSV files, Format and clean data types, Filter and sort records based on conditions, Apply aggregate functions (sum, mean, min, max), Group dataset by categorical fields, Merge multiple DataFrames using keys, Generate structured final reports
